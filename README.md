5MinuteDesktop.sh/
  This is the main script which is tested to run on a default installation of FreeBSD 10. The
  script uses packages by way of pkgng to quickly build out a desktop with a working browser.

  These are currently two window managers that can be passed to the script:
  
  i3
  fluxbox

Todo/
  Work this into an ISO file to automate the entire process, based on FreeBSD 10 pkgng repo
